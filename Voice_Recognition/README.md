### Voice Gender Recognition Script Analysis

#### Overview
This script was designed to perform gender recognition by analyzing voice and speech. Utilizing a dataset of 3,168 recorded voice samples from male and female speakers, the script employed deep learning techniques to classify a voice as either male or female based on its acoustic properties.

#### Dataset
The dataset included various acoustic properties measured from each voice sample, such as mean frequency, standard deviation of frequency, median frequency, quantiles, interquantile range, skewness, kurtosis, spectral entropy, spectral flatness, mode frequency, frequency centroid, peak frequency, fundamental frequency measurements (mean, minimum, maximum), dominant frequency measurements (average, minimum, maximum, range), and modulation index. The target variable was the label indicating male or female.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras (or tensorflow for keras backend)

#### Setup
1. Ensured Python 3.6+ was installed on the machine.
2. Installed the required libraries using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras
   ```
   Or, for TensorFlow's implementation of Keras:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

#### Steps to Run the Script
1. **Data Pre-Processing**: Prepared the dataset for training by pre-processing the acoustic properties.
2. **Created a Deep Learning Model**: Defined and compiled the deep learning model for voice gender recognition.
3. **Quantified the Trained Model**: Evaluated the model's performance on a test set to understand its accuracy.
4. **Made Predictions**: Used the trained model to predict the gender of unseen voice samples.

#### How to Run
- The script was placed in the directory with the dataset file.
- Ran the script from a terminal or an IDE that supports Python:
  ```sh
  python voice_gender_recognition.py
  ```
- Ensured the dataset file path was correctly specified in the script.

#### Note
This script was a comprehensive solution for voice gender recognition using deep learning. The dataset's diverse acoustic properties enabled the model to learn nuanced differences between male and female voices. Adjusted the deep learning model parameters as needed to optimize performance for the specific dataset.
