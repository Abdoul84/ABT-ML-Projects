### Voice Gender Recognition Script

#### Overview
This script is designed to perform gender recognition by analyzing voice and speech. Utilizing a dataset of 3,168 recorded voice samples from male and female speakers, the script employs deep learning techniques to classify a voice as either male or female based on its acoustic properties.

#### Dataset
The dataset includes various acoustic properties measured from each voice sample, such as mean frequency, standard deviation of frequency, median frequency, quantiles, interquantile range, skewness, kurtosis, spectral entropy, spectral flatness, mode frequency, frequency centroid, peak frequency, fundamental frequency measurements (mean, minimum, maximum), dominant frequency measurements (average, minimum, maximum, range), and modulation index. The target variable is the label indicating male or female.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, keras (or tensorflow for keras backend)

#### Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn keras
   ```
   Or, if you prefer TensorFlow's implementation of Keras:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

#### Steps to Run the Script
1. **Data Pre-Processing**: Prepare the dataset for training by pre-processing the acoustic properties.
2. **Create a Deep Learning Model**: Define and compile the deep learning model for voice gender recognition.
3. **Quantify the Trained Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on a test set to understand its accuracy.
4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the gender of unseen voice samples.

#### How to Run
- Place the script in the directory with the dataset file.
- Run the script from a terminal or an IDE that supports Python:
  ```sh
  python voice_gender_recognition.py
  ```
- Ensure the dataset file path is correctly specified in the script.

#### Note
This script is a comprehensive solution for voice gender recognition using deep learning. The dataset's diverse acoustic properties enable the model to learn nuanced differences between male and female voices. Adjust the deep learning model parameters as needed to optimize performance for your specific dataset.
